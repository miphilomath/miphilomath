Hi there, 

I am Mohit Bansal and you have landed on my github profile. I am a philomath and likes to learn stuff that fascinates me. I like to tinker with hardware and learn how things work under the hood.
I work as a Backend Engineer and Devops consultant. I advocate free and opensource software and contribute my time to organize meetups in local user groups whenever I can.

I have been hibernating for the past few years to keep my mental healthy but I can still be reached out on the contact details available on my website (https://theknowledgeseeker.in).

Feel free to reach out to me if you have anything interesting to discuss or any interesting project for me to work on.

Adios!
